                <h3>Mariano Sola</h3>
                <span>Sr. Java Developer, ProKarma</span>
                <p>I had the opportunity of build a great team with Federico some years ago. He is a self confident guy who is very clear in his life objectives, a good friend, a positive thinking person, very mature and collaborative, also a honest and passionate software developer.
                He taught me several new technologies and he was always looking for improvements in different aspects of his life.
                I wish him the very best in his profesional career and personal life.</p>
